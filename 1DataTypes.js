//FIRST LESSON

Javascript data types:

Undefined: undefined
Boolean: true or false
Number: 1,2,3,4, //etc, negative numbers too
String: "this is a string. Strings hold text between '' or double quotes"
BigInt: Like number, but anything bigger than 2^32


//other kinda confusing stuff
null //sort of like 0, but not really, null is a, well, null value, it means zilch, nada, but its not equal to 0

//Other ones include objects and functions, but we can circle back later

antoher useful thing

use console.log, to log a value to the console (where you can see output)

console.log(3) //outputs three

in order to find out the type of a value, use typeof

console.log(typeof "string") //outputs "string"
