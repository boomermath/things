Mathematical operators

+ //addition
- //subtraction
* //multiplication
/ for division
** //exponents

You can also use parenthesis () like in regular order of operations

Clarification about math 

//when using let

let i = 0;

i /* i is being reassigned */ = i /* this is the current value of i */ + 1;
//same as
i += 1

i = i * 2
//same as
i *= 2;

//So you can do more advanced operations like

i = Math.sqrt(i);

//
//essentially, you are taking the current value of i, doing math with it, and then making that value the value of i

//also
i += 1
//same as
i++
